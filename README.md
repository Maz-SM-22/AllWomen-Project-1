# AllWomen-Project-1 Speed Dating Project 

This project is an example of exploratory data analysis, working with a speed dating dataset from Kaggle. You can find the link to the Kaggle dataset in the notebook. 

This is the first example I have of working with Python and with matplotlib, seaborn and plotly graphing libraries. 

My objective was to look at the profile of the people who chose to go speed dating: their interests, their age, their motivations and see how these factors impacted their success rate.
